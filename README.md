## Problem: Optimizing Delivery Routes for a Logistics company in New York

## Problem Statement: The logistics company wants to optimize its delivery routes to ensure efficient product distribution from its warehouse in new York to other cities.

## Objectives : The goal is to determine the shortest path between the warehouse(new york) and various cities, minimizing the time required for deliveries.

## Approach Used: Dijkstra's Algorithm

## Cities Involved:
1. New York( Warehouse)
2. Los Angeles
3. Chicago
4. Miami
5. Houston
6 San Francisco

## Roads (Edges) between Cities(with delivery time in minutes):
1. New York -> Los Angeles: 10 min  
   New York -> Chicago: 5 min  
   New York -> Miami: 15 min
2. Los Angeles -> Chicago: 4 min  
   Lost Angeles -> Houston: 7 min  
3. Chicago -> Houston: 8 min  
   Chicago -> San Francisco: 10 min  
4. Miami -> Houston: 6 min  
   Miami -> San Francisco: 12 min

## I have done this program in my DSA learning phase in which i implemented the concept of graph theory and dijkstra's algorithm to solve real world problem
